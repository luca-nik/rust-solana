# ðŸ¦€ rust-solana

This repository is where I experiment with coding simple dApps on Solana using Rust.

## Projects

- **lottery-tickets-native**: A native Rust program for creating a lottery ticket as a NFT on the Solana Blockchain;
- **lottery-tickets-anchor**: Kind of the same but using Anchor.
